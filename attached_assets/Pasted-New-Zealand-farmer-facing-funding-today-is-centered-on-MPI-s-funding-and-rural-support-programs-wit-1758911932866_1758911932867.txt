New Zealand farmer-facing funding today is centered on MPI’s funding and rural support programs (with RSS), the new Primary Sector Growth Fund replacing SFF Futures, targeted rural wellbeing/catchment funds, and legacy SFF Futures projects; there are no universal livestock-only grants, but co-investment and contestable funds regularly back livestock, dairy, water, and sustainable practice projects, complemented by occasional research funds in livestock emissions.
Where funding lives
•	MPI “Funding and rural support”: official hub linking to all current grant/partnership schemes, community support, catchment group support, and sector programmes; this should be the primary discovery point and it exposes RSS feeds for update monitoring.
•	Farming funds and programmes: MPI’s consolidated list for innovation and producer/community support across agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, and rural resilience; this is the best entry for livestock, dairy, water, and sustainable practices.
Current core funds
•	Primary Sector Growth Fund (PSGF): launched May 2025 to replace Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures, with NZD $246m over four years for practical, business-led projects delivering productivity and “farm and forest gate” returns; prioritizes market-driven initiatives and cost reduction.
•	Rural Wellbeing Fund: contestable fund for rural community wellbeing initiatives administered by MPI, with parallel baseline funding for Rural Support Trusts; initial budget lines were announced in May 2025.
•	Catchment groups support: Budget 2025 notes ongoing support of NZD $36m over four years via MPI for catchment groups, often tied to freshwater plans and on-farm practice improvements.
Legacy and transition
•	SFF Futures status: closed to new applications on 23 May 2025 and replaced by PSGF; existing SFF projects continue under MPI with project finder and portfolio impact analysis indicating 9x ROI modeled over 30 years.
•	SFF Futures structure insights: third-party analysis describes grant tiers (“Grants,” “Hybrids,” “Partnerships”) and minimum project sizes used before closure, which helps calibrate co-funding expectations for PSGF-style proposals.
Livestock, dairy, water, sustainability focus
•	Livestock emissions research: New Zealand historically operated the Global Partnerships in Livestock Emissions Research fund, supporting tools and practices to cut emissions in grazing systems; while that call is historical, it demonstrates NZ’s funding lineage in livestock mitigation.
•	Policy context and sector health: USDA FAS 2025 sector report highlights ongoing government focus on reducing on-farm emissions and improving freshwater farm plans, framing where PSGF and MPI supports are directed.
Practical monitoring setup
•	MPI RSS feeds: subscribe to MPI’s official RSS directory to track farming funds, programmes, and environmental funding notices without manual checks.
•	Beehive releases: monitor ministerial announcements (Agriculture/Forestry) for new contests like PSGF and Wellbeing Fund, which then link back to MPI for application details.
•	GETS tenders: some funds (e.g., Rural Wellbeing Fund governance or audits of SFF projects) appear on the GETS procurement portal as tenders/registrations; polling GETS can capture operational facets and contracting windows.
Representative programs and use cases
•	PSGF project types: productivity tools, higher-value product development, cost reduction initiatives, and practical on-farm applications suited to dairy, red meat, and mixed livestock operations; projects are expected to be commercially focused and co-funded.
•	Community and wellbeing: the Rural Wellbeing Fund and baseline support for Rural Support Trusts strengthen the people-side of farming, a relevant layer for uptake and resilience in livestock regions.
•	Continuing SFF projects: even though SFF is closed, existing dairy, water quality, and sustainable practice projects are still live and can be reference points or partners for new PSGF proposals.
Quick-start endpoint and polling list
•	MPI hub pages: Funding and rural support; Farming funds and programmes; SFF Futures (status and project finder).
•	MPI RSS: central RSS directory for news, updates, and programme notices ready for scheduler ingestion.
•	Beehive releases: PSGF and rural wellbeing budget announcements to catch new streams first.
•	GETS examples: Rural Wellbeing Fund notice and SFF Futures audit tender format, illustrating procurement channel signals.
Implementation guidance
•	Target MPI’s RSS plus the two core funding pages with change detection, then mirror intake windows and criteria into an internal tracker for livestock/dairy/water-aligned projects.
•	For each livestock segment (cattle, sheep, goats, deer, dairy), frame PSGF proposals around measurable cost-reduction, emissions reductions, or water outcomes, aligning to the government’s reduced red tape/productivity narrative from 2025 releases.
•	Maintain a watch for rural wellbeing and catchment support announcements, which often accompany on-farm practice funding and enable complementary resourcing for farmer groups.

Why these keys
•	MPI and Beehive are RSS based, so GUID or canonical link+title hashing with a day bucket provides stable dedupe for announcements and programme updates.
•	GETS exposes a unique RFx ID in open data documentation and UI; using RFx ID as the primary key prevents duplicate tenders and anchors cross source merges when ministerial/MPI posts reference a specific RFx.

Here’s a compact rules block to “keep latest publish date when duplicates conflict,” which can be dropped into any of the country schemas; it sets conflict precedence to the most recent published_at across sources and preserves alternates for traceability.

Implementation notes
•	Normalize RSS pubDate using RFC 822/1123 formats before comparison; many government RSS feeds use this standard.
•	If a source lacks pubDate, fall back to detected page date or ingest timestamp; still apply “max_date” selection to keep the newest.
