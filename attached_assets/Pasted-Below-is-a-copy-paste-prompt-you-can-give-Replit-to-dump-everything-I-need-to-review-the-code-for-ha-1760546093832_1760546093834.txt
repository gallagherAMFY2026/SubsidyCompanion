Below is a copy-paste prompt you can give Replit to dump everything I need to review the code for hallucination risk, data hygiene, and UI logic. After they paste it back, I’ll do a surgical code review.

Paste this to Replit (verbatim)

“Please print the full project tree and the ENTIRE contents of the following, in this order. Include any hidden configs and startup scripts.”

Backend

app.py (or server.py / main backend file)

All route/controller files (e.g., routes/*.py)

Data models / schema (e.g., models.py)

Validation layer (schemas, DTOs)

Any service modules (e.g., services/*.py)

Config: .replit, pyproject.toml or requirements.txt

Startup/run command

Frontend

Entry file (e.g., src/main.(js|ts|tsx))

Program card/component(s) that render program data

API client (how SC fetches data)

Any state/store (Redux/Zustand/etc.)

Environment config (where API URLs live)

Templates & LLM usage

Any prompts/templates (if any)

Any LLM/tooling calls (confirm NONE are used—or paste the code if they are)

Security / misc

Middleware (auth, rate limit, CORS)

Error handling / logging

Anything that hits the network (confirm SC does NOT scrape)

Additionally, answer these directly with code snippets where relevant:

Data source: Where does SC get program data today? (Paste the exact function that fetches data; confirm there’s no web scraping in SC.)

Schema: Paste the exact data shape SC expects (fields & types) and where it’s validated.

Link policy: Show where SC requires a link/source_url per program and where it renders it in the UI.

Empty fields: Show how SC renders missing fields (no guesses).

LLM: Confirm there is no freeform LLM call or “summarize” path; if present, paste the code.

Caching: Show any caching layer and invalidation (optional).

Moderation: If present, paste the pending/approved logic and the “diff view” (optional).

Config: Paste all env names SC reads (API base URL, tokens, feature flags).

Error states: Show UI for broken/unreachable source links.
