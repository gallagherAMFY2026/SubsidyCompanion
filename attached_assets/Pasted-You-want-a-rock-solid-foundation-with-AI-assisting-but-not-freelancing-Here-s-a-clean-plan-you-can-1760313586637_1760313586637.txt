You want a rock-solid foundation, with AI assisting but not freelancing. Here’s a clean plan you can hand to Replit plus the first asset (a canonical Canada spreadsheet template) so we start right.

1) Note to Replit (paste this verbatim)

Subject: Temporary revert + staged rebuild of data foundation

Team—quick alignment on data hygiene and rollout:

Please revert the app to the last known-good production dataset (the 180-ish Canadian programs already in Postgres). Do not overwrite or drop these rows.

Hold all “V2” content in staging (do not surface to users) until we provide a clean, validated import per territory. If you’re using a feature flag, set FEATURE_V2=0. If you’re using schemas, route all reads to public.* only.

We will deliver one territory at a time, starting with Canada, in a single canonical spreadsheet with a stable schema and a companion docs manifest (web/PDF).

Replit’s job:

Import the canonical sheet into programs + program_attributes.

Import the docs manifest (PDFs/webpages) into docs (or resources) with integrity fields (sha256 for files, canonical source_url for webpages).

Keep the existing React UI and Express API; only the data ingestion changes.

Outcome: deterministic filters, stable links, clear provenance. Bot and UI will read the same source of truth.

We’ll confirm when Canada is clean and ready to promote; then move to the US. Until then, please keep V2 out of production.

2) What we’re doing (farmer-first, same shape everywhere)

We’re creating one spreadsheet per territory with a repeatable, farmer-friendly schema:

Program Summary – plain-language purpose, target recipients, outcomes.

Eligibility Criteria – farm type, scale, commodity, geography, org status, special categories.

Required Documentation – identity/registration, land tenure, financials, project plan, permits/co-funding.

Application Process & Deadlines – steps, open/close or rolling, contacts/assistance.

Funding Details – amount, categories covered (equipment/infrastructure/training/etc.), match or reimbursement %, reporting obligations.

Official Application Link – the one canonical URL.

Documents – PDFs or official webpages, stored and referenced deterministically.

3) Your clean spreadsheet (download)

This is the canonical Canada template with two sheets: Programs and Docs. Use this as the basis for the “rock solid” foundation.

Programs has stable columns (identity, geography, summary, eligibility, funding, deadlines, process, required docs, links, contacts, tags, provenance).
Docs links PDFs/webpages to programs or provinces (for portals) with doc_type, display_name, source_url/file_name, language, and optional sha256 (we’ll compute hashes when we ingest files).

4) Workflow we’ll follow (tight and boring)

You upload the original structured sheet(s) (e.g., “Subsidies and Cut-Offs/CA”) and any province tabs you want us to normalize.

I map and clean: pull every usable program into the Programs sheet (one row per program), put non-program links into Docs as webpage/portal.

We fill gaps: if any required field is missing, I flag it; you confirm or provide the link/amount/date.

We ingest into Replit’s existing Postgres tables (programs, program_attributes, docs)—no rewrite.

We promote Canada when the set is verified; then repeat for the US.

5) Guardrails that keep us safe

Revert + freeze prod: keep the current 180 in place for users.

Stage V2: all new cleaning and imports live in staging until you give the green light.

Deterministic docs: every “View PDF” or “View on Web” is traceable to docs with source_url or sha256.

Verification fields: status, last_reviewed_utc, reviewed_by, evidence_url so we can prove “active” vs “archived.”
